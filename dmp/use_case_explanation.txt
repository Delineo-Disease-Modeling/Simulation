The matrix values for this specific individual—a 65-year-old unvaccinated male—were selected to reflect the elevated risks and prolonged disease progression expected based on his demographic profile. Here’s the rationale for each of the matrices:

1. Mean Matrix Justification:
The mean matrix defines the average time an individual stays in each state before transitioning to the next. For this 65-year-old unvaccinated male:

Longer mean values (e.g., 10 days in the ICU, 14 days in recovery) reflect the higher likelihood of severe illness. Older, unvaccinated individuals typically experience longer hospital stays and ICU treatment, so we have increased the average time spent in these states.
Moderately high values for symptomatic states (e.g., 7 days in the symptomatic infectious state) reflect that older individuals tend to have a more prolonged disease progression compared to younger or vaccinated individuals.
Shorter periods in asymptomatic states (e.g., 3 days for asymptomatic infectious) reflect that severe outcomes are more likely, meaning those who develop symptoms are more likely to remain in that state for longer periods before transitioning to hospitalization or recovery.
These values are set to reflect the slower recovery rate and greater severity that a 65-year-old unvaccinated male might face, based on scientific data on COVID-19.

2. Standard Deviation Matrix Justification:
The standard deviation matrix accounts for variability in the time spent in each state. For example:

Higher variability in severe states (e.g., 2.5-3.0 days in ICU and hospitalization) reflects the unpredictability in the progression of severe COVID-19 cases in older adults. Some patients may stay longer due to complications, while others may progress more quickly toward recovery or ICU.
Lower variability in earlier states (e.g., 1.0-1.5 days in symptomatic or asymptomatic states) reflects that early disease progression is more predictable, especially in older, unvaccinated individuals.
The variability acknowledges that while most unvaccinated older individuals have longer disease courses, there are exceptions due to factors such as pre-existing conditions or access to early treatment.

3. Max Cutoff Matrix Justification:
The max cutoff matrix defines the upper bound of time an individual can spend in each state. The values are chosen to reflect the worst-case scenarios for this demographic:

High max cutoff values for hospitalization and ICU states (e.g., 12-18 days in the ICU or 14-16 days in hospitalization) reflect that older, unvaccinated individuals are at risk of longer recovery times or extended ICU stays. This aligns with real-world data where elderly patients can remain in critical care for prolonged periods.
Moderate max cutoff values for infectious states (e.g., 7-10 days for symptomatic infectious) are based on standard COVID-19 recovery times but are increased for unvaccinated individuals who may experience slower recovery.
These values represent the upper limit for how long this demographic might stay in each state, accounting for the severity of the Delta variant and the vulnerability of unvaccinated, older adults.

4. Distribution Type Matrix Justification:
The distribution type matrix uses a mix of normal, exponential, and uniform distributions:

Exponential distributions are used for transitions like infection to symptomatic states (e.g., 2 in IS or IA transitions), reflecting rapid, uncertain disease progression in early stages. For an unvaccinated elderly person, this matches the unpredictable onset of symptoms or rapid deterioration.
Normal distributions are used in transitions between longer, more predictable states, such as recovery or ICU stays (e.g., 1 in the ICU or hospitalization). This reflects that while the duration of severe illness is variable, it tends to cluster around a mean duration, especially in ICU and recovery.
Uniform distributions are applied in transitions like hospitalization or recovery (e.g., 3 for hospitalization) to represent the equal likelihood of a wide range of possible outcomes in severely ill older patients.
The mix of these distributions aligns with real-world variability in disease progression, providing flexibility in modeling outcomes for this specific demographic.

Overall Justification:
This set of matrix values is carefully tailored to reflect the increased risks, slower recovery rates, and variability in disease progression that a 65-year-old unvaccinated male might face if infected with a severe COVID-19 variant like Delta. The values take into account:

Higher probabilities of severe outcomes like hospitalization and ICU due to age and unvaccinated status.
Longer time spent in critical states like ICU and hospitalization, with greater variability in these states.
Faster disease progression in early stages (symptomatic and asymptomatic), reflecting the rapid onset of severe symptoms in high-risk groups.
The matrices are designed to give a realistic, data-driven representation of how this demographic would likely experience the disease, providing meaningful insights for simulations.
